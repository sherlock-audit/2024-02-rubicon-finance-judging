# Fees not set in initialize()

## Summary
The initialize() function in the [RubiconFeeController](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol) contract does not set the [baseFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L24) for the new proxy, potentially causing incorrect fee calculation for the new proxy.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the initialize() function of the RubiconFeeController contract, the baseFee is not set, leaving it at its default value of 10. Since this contract is intended to be used as an implementation for a proxy, the baseFee will be 0 for the proxy and will lead to incorrect fees calculation.

## Impact
The impact of this issue is that newly created proxy instances will have a baseFee value of 0 instead of the 10, leading to incorrect fee calculations potentially leading to loss to protocol.

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    uint256 public baseFee = 10;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set baseFee in initialize() function like below.
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _feeRecipient,
    uint256 _baseFee
) external override {
    if (initialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();
    owner = _owner;
    feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    baseFee = _baseFee; // Set the desired baseFee for the new proxy

    initialized = true;
}
```
