# Front-running vulnerability in `BaseGladiusReactor`

## Summary

The `_fill()` function in the `BaseGladiusReactor`contract lacks a check to verify if the recipient can receive Ether, which can lead to a vulnerability where contracts unable to receive Ether inadvertently receive it, potentially causing transactions to revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the `_fill()` function in the `BaseGladiusReactor` contract. This function does not check if the recipient (`msg.sender`) is a contract that can receive Ether. Therefore, if a contract incapable of receiving Ether calls the `execute*()` functions with Ether in the contract's balance,  the transaction will revert. This presents an opportunity for front-running attacks, where attackers can exploit vulnerable transactions to cause them to revert.  Indeed, an attacker can send Ether to `BaseGladiusReactor`just before the `execute*()` function is called by a vulnerable contract, causing the transaction to revert.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that valid transactions can unexpectedly revert if the user contract isn't able to receive funds. This can lead to disruptions in the expected behavior of transactions and potentially result in financial losses or other adverse effects for users interacting with the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, a check should be added within the `_fill` function to verify if the recipient (`msg.sender`) is capable of receiving Ether. 
This can be achieved by implementing a function or modifier that checks if the recipient is a contract and has a `payable fallback` function or `receive()` function.
