# Missing address validation for `RubiconFeeController.feeRecipient` can lead to fees being misdirected or lost

## Summary
There are no mechanisms to check if the provided address for `feeRecipient` is valid or not.

This issue addresses concerns the Rubicon team has as mentioned in the contest QnA as stated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/README.md#q-are-there-any-additional-protocol-roles-if-yes-please-explain-in-detail)

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin of the fee controller can provide an invalid address for `feeRecipient` in the `initialize()` and `setFeeRecipient()` functions. This value is used in the `getFeeOutputs()` function [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/11cac67919e8a1303b3a3177291b88c0c70bf03b/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L102).

## Impact

- The address for `feeRecipient` being invalid leads fee being lost or misdirected.
