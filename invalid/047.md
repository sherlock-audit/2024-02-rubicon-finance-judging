# Missing address(0) checks for `_owner` in  `RubiconFeeController.initialize()` and `BaseGladiusReactor.initialize()`

## Summary
The `initialize()` functions set the owner of the contract without checking if the provided address is the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail
`initialize()` functions can set `address(0)` as the owner of the contract. Furthermore, the `setOwner()` method cannot be called afterward to change the owner of a deployed contract.

## Impact
Setting the owner of the contract wrongly will cause the deployed contract to be unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a zero address check before setting the owner such as: 
`require(_owner != address(0), "Invalid address");`
