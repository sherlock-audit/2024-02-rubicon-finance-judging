# GladiusReactor allows no decay on orders.

## Summary

Missing check in ```_validateOrder``` function   in ```GladiusReactor```  contract allows orders with identical ```decayStartTime``` and ```decayEndTime``` , causing potential issues for users and the protocol itself.

## Vulnerability Detail


When GladiusReactor resolves a signed order, it validates orders via the ```_validateOrder```  function. 

 ```_validateOrder``` function has implemented in  ```GladiusReactor```  contract as follows:

```solidity

            function _validateOrder(GladiusOrder memory order) internal pure {
            ...
            ...


            if (order.decayEndTime < order.decayStartTime) 
            revert OrderEndTimeBeforeStartTime();

            ...
            ...
            ... }
```


However, ```_validateOrder``` function currently lacks implementation for checking whether ```decayStartTime ```  is equal to```decayEndTime```  or not.  ```decayStartTime ```  can not be equal to```decayEndTime``` because it causes creating orders that never decays. 

## Impact
 
The ```resolve``` function is responsible for processing and executing signed orders on the ```GladiusReactor``` contract. The vulnerability lies in the fact that  when ```resolve``` function calls  ```_validateOrder``` function to validate order , it does not properly validate the ```decayStartTime``` and ```decayEndTime``` parameters of an order. This means that an attacker could potentially create an order with a ```decayStartTime``` that is equal to  ```decayEndTime```. Such an order would never decay, and the attacker could use it to exploit the protocol or cause financial losses for other users or the protocol itself.

## Recommendation

add following line on GladiusReactor L141

```diff

-        if (order.decayEndTime < order.decayStartTime)
+        if (order.decayEndTime <= order.decayStartTime)
```
