# setGladiusReactor function has no zero address check.

## Summary

On ```RubiconFeeController```  ,  ```setGladiusReactor``` simply sets new GladiusReactor contract address for the protocol.  which could lead to fund loses for protocol.


## Vulnerability Detail

On ```RubiconFeeController```  ,  ```setGladiusReactor``` simply sets new GladiusReactor contract for the protocol.  However ,as you can see  there is no zero address check on this function even though it has made by trusted actors in ```auth``` modifier.

```solidity
       function setGladiusReactor(address payable gr) external auth {
	gladiusReactor = GladiusReactor(gr);
    }
```
Trusted actors could pass zero address to ```setGladiusReactor```  function by mistake. This leads to locking the protocol itself and causes to fund loses for protocol

## Impact

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue kindly consider to add following

```solidity
       function setGladiusReactor(address payable gr) external auth {
        require(gr != address(0) , "zero address"); // add this line
        gladiusReactor = GladiusReactor(gr);
}
```
