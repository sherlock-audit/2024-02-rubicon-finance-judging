# Upgradeable contracts should implement ERC-7201 name spacing to reduce the risk of storage collisions

## Summary
According to the sponsor, the following contracts in scope are upgradeable : ```GladiusReactor``` && ```RubiconFeeController```.
```DSAuth```and ```ProxyConstructor```are inherited contracts in ```RubiconFeeController```.  These two inherited contracts should implement ERC-7201 or similar to reduce the risk of storage collision.
On top of this, ```BaseGladiusReactor```, which is inherited by ```GladiusReactor```, uses ```ReentrancyGuard``` by Openzeppelin. For the same reason, it should instead use ```ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable``` (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol)

## Vulnerability Detail
When upgrading a contract, there is the risk of storage collision if the storage layout is not compatible between different versions of the logic contract. 

## Impact
When a contract is upgraded, the slot to be used for storing a given variable can be the same slot previously used by a different variable. This would cause the contract to malfunction potentially putting the contract at risk.

## Recommendation
Implementation of ERC-7201 or any other method for reducing the risk of storage collisions.
