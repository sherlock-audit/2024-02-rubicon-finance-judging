# Base fee will be initialised to the wrong amount when `RubiconFeeController` is deployed using a proxy

## Summary
Base fee rate will be initialised to zero instead of 0.01% on the `RubiconFeeController` proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The default value for `baseFee` in `RubiconFeeController` is set to `10` in a storage field declaration.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/11cac67919e8a1303b3a3177291b88c0c70bf03b/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L16-L24
```solidity
contract RubiconFeeController is
    IProtocolFeeController,
    DSAuth,
    ProxyConstructor
{
    ...
    uint256 public baseFee = 10;
```
This is equivalent to setting `baseFee` in the constructor. However, `RubiconFeeController` is intended to be accessed via a proxy as indicated by inheriting from `ProxyConstructor` and the proxy cannot call the constructor of the implementation contract. It instead calls `initialize` (via `delegatecall`) to set its initial storage values. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/11cac67919e8a1303b3a3177291b88c0c70bf03b/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L39-L48
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _owner,
        address _feeRecipient
    ) external override {
        if (initialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();
        owner = _owner;
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;

        initialized = true;
    }
```
We can see `baseFee` is not set here. Consequently, while `baseFee = 10` on the *implementation* contract, `baseFee = 0` in the proxy storage.

## Impact
This can open up a window of opportunity for fillers to execute orders without paying any fee if unnoticed at deployment.

## Recommendation
Initialise `baseFee` to `10` in `RubiconFeeController::initialize`.
