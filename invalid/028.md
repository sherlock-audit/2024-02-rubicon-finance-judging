# Medium - Flawed logic inside `getFeeOutputs()` function

## Summary
`getFeeOutputs()` applies fees to the output token and returns it, but the logic inside this function is flawed.

## Vulnerability Detail
First, this [loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L73) is supposed to update the fee amount if it is the correct output token, except under the current logic, this loop can never be reached. This is because `feeCount` is initialized with the default `uint256` value of 0, never updated, and then used inside the for loop conditional that says "run while 0 is less than 0", which obviously can never be true.

```solidity
uint256 feeCount;
for (uint256 j = 0; j < feeCount; ++j) {
```

Even if we updated the for loop's conditional to say "run while 0 is less than or equal to 0" (`j <= feeCount;`), the next issue lies directly inside of the loop:

```solidity
result = new OutputToken[](order.outputs.length);

 for (uint256 j = 0; j <= feeCount; ++j) {
                    OutputToken memory feeOutput = result[j];
                    if (feeOutput.token == tokenOut) {
                        found = true;
                        feeOutput.amount += feeAmount;
                    }
                }
```
We initialize `result` as the empty `OutputToken` array with a length of 1, then we set `feeOutput` as an `OutputToken` object, using `result`, and finally, we try to compare a value between an empty object with uninitialized values, to an actual value that was passed as input to the function. This means it is essentially the same as this when using an actual ERC20 output:

```solidity
if(address(0) == address(1337)
```

Unless using native currency like ETH as address(0), this `if` statement will **never** be true meaning the `bool found` will always be false, and `feeOutput.amount` will never be incremented by `feeAmount`. However, even if the previous logic was correct so that this `if` statement could be reached, the only thing returned from the function would be the empty `result` object since it is never actually updated.

There is one additional bug I found in this function: if the `feeAmount` is returned as 0, meaning there is no fee on the pair, then the result is returned as an empty `OutputToken[](1)` with default values for everything, which will once again cause any future logic relying on these variables to fail or break in unexpected ways.

```solidity
if (feeAmount != 0) {
```

## Impact
Code inside of `getFeeOutputs()` can never be reached or could return a struct with uninitialized values.

## Code Snippet
This is the entire function that I broke apart and explained above, you can view the entire file [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L63).

```solidity
function getFeeOutputs(
        ResolvedOrder memory order
    ) external view override returns (OutputToken[] memory result) {	
        /// @notice Right now the length is enforced by
        ///         'GladiusReactor' to be equal to 1.
        result = new OutputToken[](order.outputs.length);

        address tokenIn = address(order.input.token);
        uint256 feeCount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < order.outputs.length; ++i) {
            /// @dev Fee will be in the 'tokenOut' form.
            address tokenOut = order.outputs[i].token;

            PairBasedFee memory fee = fees[
                getPairHash(address(tokenIn), tokenOut)
            ];

            uint256 feeAmount = fee.applyFee
                ? order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(fee.fee, DENOM)
                : order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(baseFee, DENOM);

            /// @dev If fee is applied to pair.
            if (feeAmount != 0) {
                bool found;

                for (uint256 j = 0; j < feeCount; ++j) {
                    OutputToken memory feeOutput = result[j];

                    if (feeOutput.token == tokenOut) {
                        found = true;
                        feeOutput.amount += feeAmount;
                    }
                }

                if (!found) {
                    result[feeCount] = OutputToken({
                        token: tokenOut,
                        amount: feeAmount,
                        recipient: feeRecipient
                    });
                    feeCount++;
                }
            }
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Update the `for` loop to use a conditional that says `j <= feeCount` as opposed to `<`.
- Revise logic on how local variables are set so that uninitialized values aren't carried over to new variables (unless this is intentional). 
- Ensure values that are used inside conditional `if` statements are initialized.
- Update the `else` conditionals or at least ensure that the `result` object that is returned never contains empty/default values.
