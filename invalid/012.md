# Lack of Explicit Owner Verification in Authentication Mechanism

## Summary
The smart contract lacks explicit verification of the owner's identity within its authentication mechanism, which introduces a security risk. Without proper validation, unauthorized entities could potentially gain access to privileged functionalities reserved for the contract owner.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `isAuthorized `function and the `auth `modifier. Here's a detailed explanation:
```solidity
modifier auth() {
        if (!isAuthorized(msg.sender)) revert Unauthorized();
        _;
    }

    function isAuthorized(address src) internal view returns (bool) {
        if (src == owner) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
The `isAuthorized` function is intended to determine whether a given address (`src`) is the owner of the contract by comparing it with the owner variable. However, it lacks explicit verification of the caller's identity (`msg.sender`). Consequently, any address that matches the current owner value could potentially bypass the authentication check.

## Impact
Without proper authentication and access control, malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate fee structures, leading to financial losses, unfair fee distributions, and disruption of protocol operations. For instance, an attacker could set arbitrary and invalid fee values beyond the acceptable boundaries defined by the `GladiusReactor` contract, leading to inconsistencies in fee calculations or even contract malfunction.
