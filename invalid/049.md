# No storage gap for upgradeable contracts `GladiusReactor` and `RubiconFeeController`

## Summary
The upgradeable contracts `GladiusReactor` and `RubiconFeeController` have no storage gaps which can lead to a storage overwrite during upgrade

## Vulnerability Detail
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. 

Refer to the bottom part of this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

## Impact
when `GladiusReactor` and `RubiconFeeController` do not contain any storage gaps, In future upgrades if an additional variable is added to these contracts, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the last variable in their respective child contracts

## Code Snippet
No storage gaps in `GladiusReactor`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts, Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.
