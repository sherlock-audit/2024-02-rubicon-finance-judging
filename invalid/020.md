# RubiconFeeController contract initializes the "baseFee" in constructor but the contract is upgradable

## Summary
RubiconFeeController contract is an upgradable contract but it tries to set the "baseFee" in the constructor. However, due to upgradable contracts not aware of the constructor state, the "baseFee" will not be updated.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the code, "baseFee" is initially set to "10", but it is not defined as a constant or immutable value. Therefore, any updates made to it will not be reflected in the storage of the upgradable contracts. Consequently, the value of "baseFee" will remain as "0". Fillers who are fulfilling the orders can exploit this situation by executing the orders without incurring any fees.

## Impact
When protocol notices that they set the baseFee as "0" they can use this function to set it to a desired value:

However, until protocol team notices this all the orders filled will be used "0" fee which is not desired as we can see the set function can't set the fee to "0". 

Considering protocol team didn't notice this, I'll label this as medium.

## Recommendation
Set the baseFee inside the initialize function
