# zero address verification.

## Summary
The setOwner function does not check if the owner_ parameter is a non-zero address or we are setting the same owner again. Setting the owner to the zero address could result in a loss of contract control.

There is no multi-signature or timelock functionality for the setOwner function, which means that if the owner's private key is compromised, the attacker can immediately take full control of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
 function setOwner(address owner_) external auth {
        owner = owner_;
        emit LogSetOwner(owner);
    }
## Impact
setting the owner to the zero address could result in a loss of contract control.
