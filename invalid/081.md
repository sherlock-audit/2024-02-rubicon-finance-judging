# `getFeeOutputs` does not work as intended due to a wrong comparison

medium

## Summary
The `getFeeOutputs` does not work as intended due to a wrong comparison in the for loop.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L63) `getFeeOutputs`, the `feeOutput.token` is being compared to the `result[j]` in the second for loop. The loop iterates while `j < feeCount`. The problem here is that `feeCount`'s default value is `0` and it is being updated at the end of the first for loop. This means that on the first iteration of the main loop, the `feeCount`'s value would not have incremented to `1`, which will lead to the for loop not entering its body, therefore skipping the check and missing the `0` index element.

## Impact
The `0` index element will be skipped which will lead to wrong functionality of the function.

## Code Snippet
#### `getFeeOutputs` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L89):
```solidity
    function getFeeOutputs(
        ResolvedOrder memory order
    ) external view override returns (OutputToken[] memory result) {	
        /// @notice Right now the length is enforced by
        ///         'GladiusReactor' to be equal to 1.
        result = new OutputToken[](order.outputs.length);

        address tokenIn = address(order.input.token);
@>        uint256 feeCount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < order.outputs.length; ++i) {
            /// @dev Fee will be in the 'tokenOut' form.
            address tokenOut = order.outputs[i].token;

            PairBasedFee memory fee = fees[
                getPairHash(address(tokenIn), tokenOut)
            ];

            uint256 feeAmount = fee.applyFee
                ? order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(fee.fee, DENOM)
                : order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(baseFee, DENOM);

            /// @dev If fee is applied to pair.
            if (feeAmount != 0) {
                bool found;

@>                for (uint256 j = 0; j < feeCount; ++j) {
                    OutputToken memory feeOutput = result[j];

                    if (feeOutput.token == tokenOut) {
                        found = true;
                        feeOutput.amount += feeAmount;
                    }
                }

                if (!found) {
                    result[feeCount] = OutputToken({
                        token: tokenOut,
                        amount: feeAmount,
                        recipient: feeRecipient
                    });
@>                    feeCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        .
        .
        .
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to ensure that you cover the `0` index check, either add an additional check in the for loop for the case when `feeCount` equals `0` , or add an additional check for that specifical case outside of the for loop.
