# Arbitrary external call in order validation flow can cause OOG revert/error and grief the order filler

## Summary
(See Impact section for a link to the Sherlock rules, which states OOG errors can be considered M/H.) 

The maker of an order can provide an arbitrary contract address for additional order validation; a malicious user can abuse this and cause the filling transaction to OOG revert/error.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute()` function in `BaseGladiusReactor` calls the internal `_prepare()` function, which uses the `ResolvedOrderLib.validate()` function to validate the order.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/lib/ResolvedOrderLib.sol

The below code in `ResolvedOrderLib.validate()` is a problem because it contains an arbitrary external call, since the order maker can set the address of `resolvedOrder.info.additionalValidationContract` to any value.
```solidity
        if (
            address(resolvedOrder.info.additionalValidationContract) !=
            address(0)
        ) {
            resolvedOrder.info.additionalValidationContract.validate(
                filler,
                resolvedOrder
            );
        }
```

A malicious order maker can use this external call to consume all of the gas provided for the transaction, effectively griefing the order filler and causing them to lose the maximum possible gas fees provided for the transaction. 
## Impact
When a order filler tries to fill the order, the malicious external call will consume all of the gas provided and cause an OOG revert/error. The order filler will lose all of the gas fees provided for the transaction. (OOG can be considered M/H according to the Sherlock rules: https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#viii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-considered-valid)

## Recommendation
Call `resolvedOrder.info.additionalValidationContract.validate()` with a reasonable gas limit.
