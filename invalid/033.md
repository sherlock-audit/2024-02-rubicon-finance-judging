# Missing address validation for `RubiconFeeController.gladiusReactor` can lead to reverts

## Summary
There are no mechanisms to check if the provided address for the gladius reactor is valid or not.

This issue addresses concerns the Rubicon team has as mentioned in the contest QnA as stated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/README.md#q-are-there-any-additional-protocol-roles-if-yes-please-explain-in-detail)

`A potential concern and non-intended outcome is that if the admin sets invalid parameters, ...`

## Vulnerability Detail
The admin of the fee controller can provide an arbitrary address for the gladius reactor in the `setGladiusReactor(address payable gr)` function. As there is no address validation, it can potentially be set to an invalid  0 address.

## Impact
When an invalid address is set for `gladiusReactor`, it will cause the contract to revert due to errors when it is called later on in the contract such as in the function `setPairBasedFee()` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/11cac67919e8a1303b3a3177291b88c0c70bf03b/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L126) and `setBaseFee()` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/11cac67919e8a1303b3a3177291b88c0c70bf03b/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L133).

## Recommendation
Ensure that only valid addresses are allowed to be set to prevent DOS.
