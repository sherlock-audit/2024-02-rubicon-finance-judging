# GladiusReactor::`eth` locked permanently in contract

## Summary
There is no function/mechanism to withdraw ether from `GladiusReactor.sol` contract, as a result ether will be locked in this contract permanently.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `BaseGladiusReactor.sol` contract was designed to receive ether directly:
```solidity
    receive() external payable {}    
```
Additionally it has multiple `payable` functions:
To partial/full execution of order -
1. `execute(SignedOrder calldata order,uint256 quantity )`
2. `executeWithCallback(SignedOrder calldata order,uint256 quantity,bytes calldata callbackData)`
3. `executeBatch(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, uint256[] calldata quantities)`
4. `executeBatchWithCallback(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, uint256[] calldata quantities, bytes calldata callbackData)`

To full execution of order - 
1. `execute(SignedOrder calldata order)`
2. `executeWithCallback(SignedOrder calldata order, bytes calldata callbackData)`
3. `executeBatch(SignedOrder[] calldata orders)`
4. `executeBatchWithCallback(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, bytes calldata callbackData)`

This abstract contract is inherited by `GladiusReactor.sol` contract. However, there is no function to withdraw ether which will be sent to this contract directly & by calling mentioned functions.
## Impact
As there are no mechanism/function to withdraw ether from this contract, all ethers, which will be sent to this `GladiusReactor.sol`, will be locked permanently.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a withdraw function in `GladiusReactor.sol` to withdraw ether from this contract.
