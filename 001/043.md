# `getFeeOutputs` fees are improperly calculated

## Summary

for `getFeeOutputs` in RubiconFeeController, fees are improperly calculated, leading to loss of fees for the fee recipient

## Vulnerability Detail

In `getFeeOutputs`, there exists the following code:

```solidity
                for (uint256 j = 0; j < feeCount; ++j) {
                    OutputToken memory feeOutput = result[j];

                    if (feeOutput.token == tokenOut) {
                        found = true;
                        feeOutput.amount += feeAmount;
                    }
                }
```

Because `feeOutput` is a `memory` variable, however, the feeOutput amount is not actually updated here (in the event that the token already exists in `result`). It should instead be storage so that the feeOutput is updated. This leads to under-calculation of fees, leading to the fee recipient losing out on fees. 

## Impact

Fee recipient receiving less fees than expected
