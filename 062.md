# setFeeRecipient checks no "zero address" parameter

## Summary

On ```RubiconFeeController```  ,  ```setFeeRecipient``` simply sets new fee recipient for the protocol.  However ,as you can see  there is no zero address check on this function even though it has made by trusted actors in ```auth``` modifier.


```solidity
        function setFeeRecipient(address recipient) external auth {
        feeRecipient = recipient;
    } 
```


## Vulnerability Detail

On ```RubiconFeeController```  ,  ```setFeeRecipient``` simply sets new fee recipient for the protocol.  However ,as you can see  there is no zero address check on this function even though it has made by trusted actors in ```auth``` modifier.

```solidity
        function setFeeRecipient(address recipient) external auth {
        feeRecipient = recipient;
    } 
```

## Impact
Trusted actors could pass zero address to ```setFeeRecipient```  function by mistake. This leads to fee loses for protocol.
