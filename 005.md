# BaseGladiusReactor.sol::`_fill()`:There is no check for whether the token has code or not

## Summary
In `BaseGladiusReactor.sol::_fill()`  `SafeTransferLib` is using for ERC20, but the function does not have any check for whether the ERC20 token has any code or not, so an attacker can use a token which does not have any code i.e invalid token & as a result the token will be transfered but will not credited because there is no token exist at all.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `SafeTransferLib.sol` library a [note](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/c892309933b25c03d32b1b0d674df7ae292ba925/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9) is clearly mentioned:
### @dev Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.
The `BaseGladiusReactor.sol` contract using `SafeTransferLib.sol` for ERC20 interactions:
```solidity
    using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;
```
In `BaseGladiusReactor.sol::_fill()` has an external call on `token` of [`OutputToken[]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/base/ReactorStructs.sol#L37-L41), this token is need to be received by recipient to satisfy an order. But this `_fill()` does not have any check for whether the `token` has any code or not. 
The external call is called to `CurrencyLibrary.sol::transferFill()`, in this function the `safeTransferFrom()` is called to send the token to recipient, the `CurrencyLibrary.sol` contract also using `SafeTransferLib` for ERC20. Unfortunately this `transferFill()` also does not have any check for token code.

## Impact
As Rubicon supports trading of any token which adheres to ERC20 standard and one can add a new token so an attacker can use a token which does not have any code i.e invalid token, so when `safeTransferFrom()` [`SafeTransferLib.sol` dependant] is called on that token the token transfer will succeed with no error but the token will not be credited to recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OZ's `safeTransferFrom()` or put a check for whether the token has a code or not.
