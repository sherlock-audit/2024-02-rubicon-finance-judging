# Incomplete Struct Definition in PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE

## Summary
The `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE` struct definition in the Solidity code lacks a complete representation of the Gladius order type, potentially leading to inaccuracies in hashing and unexpected behaviour.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE` struct is intended to represent the type of a permit order, including various sub-structs such as the witness, Gladius order, Dutch order outputs, order info, and token permissions. However, the definition of `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE` does not include a complete representation of the Gladius order type. Instead, it only includes the `GLADIUS_ORDER_TYPE`, which represents the Gladius order itself but omits its dependencies defined in the `ORDER_TYPE`.
Here is the code snippet representing the incomplete definition of `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE`:
```solidity
string internal constant PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE =
    string(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "GladiusOrder witness)",
            DutchOrderLib.DUTCH_OUTPUT_TYPE,
            GLADIUS_ORDER_TYPE, // Incomplete definition of Gladius order type
            OrderInfoLib.ORDER_INFO_TYPE,
            DutchOrderLib.TOKEN_PERMISSIONS_TYPE
        )
    );
```
## Impact
The incomplete struct definition in `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE` can lead to inaccuracies in hashing and potentially unexpected behaviour in the handling of permit orders. Without including all necessary sub-struct types, the hashing of permit orders may not accurately represent their complete structure, leading to inconsistencies or errors in contract execution.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE` definition should include the complete Gladius order type along with its dependencies. Specifically, the `ORDER_TYPE`, which encompasses the Gladius order along with its dependencies, should be included in the definition of `PERMIT2_ORDER_TYPE`.
