# Ownership change in a single step

## Summary
The `DSAuth.setOwner()` function is used to change ownership of contracts. This function changes the owner in a single step without confirmation from the new owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Owners of the contracts are privileged users who perform various administrative tasks. When an owner calls `DSAuth.setOwner()` with an address, the ownership is immediately revoked and transferred to the provided address in a single step. No confirmation from the new owner is required.

Furthermore, the function also does not check if the provided address is `address(0)`.

## Impact
Ownership (administrative privilege) can be lost to an uncontrolled account if the current owner provides an invalid address for the new owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When changing ownership of a contract, a two-step approach is recommended: 

1. The current owner proposes a new address for change. 
2. The proposed new address then claims ownership in a separate transaction. 

Additionally, add checks for `address(0)` in the function.
