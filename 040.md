# GladiusOrderQuoter::No limitation on returned bytes

## Summary
The `GladiusOrderQuoter::quote()` does not have any limitation on `bytes` size of returned error results exceeding memory limit and will cause runtime error.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`quote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/lens/GladiusOrderQuoter.sol#L26-L40) catches the error message in bytes form:
```solidity
        {} catch (bytes memory reason) {
```
However, this function does not  have any check for maximum limit of returned bytes.
## Impact
If the returned bytes is too large and if it exceeds the memory limit the transaction will revert and the expected `ResolvedOrder memory
result` will not be returned.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put expected maximum limit of returned `bytes` for `reason`.
