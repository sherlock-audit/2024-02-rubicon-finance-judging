# setOwner will always revert without setting owner

## Summary
setOwner in DSAuth.sol will always revert without setting owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
modifier auth() invokes isAuthorized(msg.sender) which returns false before set owner.
By the way, setOwner() has auth modifier, so can't set owner. And then all functions with modifier auth() can't be called since of this issue.

## Impact
All functions with modifier auth() can't be called forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is to set owner on constructor rather than current implementation
