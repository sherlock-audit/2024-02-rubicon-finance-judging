# The feeController differs from it's specification as setting 'applyFee' to false doesn't disable BOTH Dynamic pair-based and base fee but only Dynamic pair-based fee

## Summary
The feeController differs from it's specification as setting 'applyFee' to false doesn't disable BOTH Dynamic pair-based and base fee but only Dynamic pair-based fee

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [contract's specification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/fee-controllers/RubiconFeeController.sol#L15), setting 'applyFee' to false should disable both Dynamic pair-based fee and base fee

>  ///      * Both dynamic and base fee can be disabled by setting 'applyFee' to false.

However, `applyFee` has a different usage in the code:
```solidity
uint256 feeAmount = fee.applyFee
                ? order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(fee.fee, DENOM)
                : order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(baseFee, DENOM);
```
Instead, setting this value is used for specifying which fee is to used between both
## Impact
Arbitrageurs and Aggregators that trade for expected output return opportunity on tokens with applyFee not set and therefore false with the belief that both fees are disabled due to the specification will receive incorrect return values when calling execute().

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the `applyFee` variable usage implemented in the code matches it's usage in their specifications.
