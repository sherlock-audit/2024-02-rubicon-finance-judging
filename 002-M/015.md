# When `applyFee` is set to false, the base fee continues to be applied rather than being disabled.

## Summary

When `applyFee` is set to false, the base fee continues to be applied rather than being disabled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `RubiconFeeController` is responsible for handling fees. There are two fee types: a pair-based dynamic fee and a global base fee. The code comments indicates that disabling `applyFee` should turn off both the dynamic and base fees. However, the base fee continues to be applied.

## Impact

The base fee is mistakenly applied even when it should be disabled, resulting in unnecessary fees being charged on trades.

RubiconFeeController.sol
```solidity
	/// @dev Fee controller, that's intended to be called by reactors.
	///      * By default applies constant 'BASE_FEE' on output token.
	///      * Dynamic pair-based fee can be enabled by calling 'setPairBasedFee'.
>	///      * Both dynamic and base fee can be disabled by setting 'applyFee' to false.
```

RubiconFeeController.sol
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < order.outputs.length; ++i) {
            /// @dev Fee will be in the 'tokenOut' form.
            address tokenOut = order.outputs[i].token;

            PairBasedFee memory fee = fees[
                getPairHash(address(tokenIn), tokenOut)
            ];

>           uint256 feeAmount = fee.applyFee
>               ? order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(fee.fee, DENOM)
>               : order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(baseFee, DENOM);

            /// @dev If fee is applied to pair.
            if (feeAmount != 0) {
                bool found;
```

## Tool used

VSCode

## Recommendation

Currently, there is no mechanism to disable the base fee. It is recommended to introduce a global flag to manage the base fee. An example implementation could be as follows:

```solidity

bool applyBaseFee; // Global variable.

PairBasedFee memory fee = fees[
    getPairHash(address(tokenIn), tokenOut)
];

if (fee.applyFee) {
	feeAmount = order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(fee.fee, DENOM);
} else if (applyBaseFee) {
	feeAmount = order.outputs[i].amount.mulDivUp(baseFee, DENOM)
} else {
	feeAmount = 0;
}

```
