# `BaseGladiusReactor::executeBatch` vulnerable to DOS attack

## Summary

Due to the block gas limit, there is a clear limitation in the amount of operation that can be handled in a transaction. So the `orders` comes directly from the input orders array passed by the caller, without any validation.This allows an attacker to craft a transaction with a very long but mostly empty orders array, targeting excessive gas usage again via the array allocation. Loops that  are dependent on user-controlled input can be exploited to halt the contract's functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability in the contract is related to the lack of input length validation, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Specifically, the contract fails to bound the input length, leaving it susceptible to a DoS vector through memory allocation costs. 

The problem arises from the fact that the orders variable, which is used in the contract, directly comes from the input orders array provided by the caller, without any validation. This allows an attacker to create a transaction with an excessively long but mostly empty orders array, deliberately targeting excessive gas usage through array allocation.

Loops that depend on user-controlled input can be exploited to halt the contract's functions, potentially disrupting its normal operation.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can abuse it to consume excessive gas, leading to increased costs for executing transactions on the contract.
