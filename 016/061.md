# `BaseGladiusReactor::executeBatch` vulnerable to DOS attack

## Summary
The BaseGladiusReactor contract is vulnerable to denial of service attacks due to lacking limits on the batch size for `executeBatch` calls. This allows attackers to craft transactions that consume excessive gas, targeting block gas limits.

Affected Functions

  - `executeBatch`
  - `executeBatchWithCallb`

## Vulnerability Detail
These functions allow filling multiple orders in a single transaction via a batch. However, there are no limits placed on the number of orders that can be included in a batch.

```solidity

    function executeBatch(
        SignedOrder[] calldata orders,
        uint256[] calldata quantities
    ) external payable override nonReentrant {
        uint256 ordersLength = orders.length;
        if (quantities.length != ordersLength) revert LengthMismatch();

        ResolvedOrder[] memory resolvedOrders = new ResolvedOrder[](
            ordersLength
        );

        unchecked {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < ordersLength; i++) {
                resolvedOrders[i] = resolve(orders[i], quantities[i]);
            }
        }
```

An attacker could craft a transaction with an abnormally large number of orders, consuming far more gas than typical transactions. If submitted close to the block gas limit, it could cause other legitimate transactions to fail due to hitting the limit.


## Impact
Users suffer from higher transaction costs if gas prices increase due to bloating
