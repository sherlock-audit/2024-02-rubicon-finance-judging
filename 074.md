# The `_fill` function allows user to steal funds that do not belong to them

medium

## Summary
Users can steal funds that do not belong to them from the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_fill` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/reactors/BaseGladiusReactor.sol#L248) is responsible for filling the list of orders, however at its bottom the whole smart contract balance is being sent to the `msg.sender`.

```solidity
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            CurrencyLibrary.transferNative(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        }
```
The `transferNative` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/lib/CurrencyLibrary.sol#L56) executes a low level call to the `msg.sender`, sending the passed parameter as an amount, which in our case is all of the funds in the smart contract.


## Impact
This will let any user collect all of the funds in the smart contact, even if all of the funds/part of the funds do not belong to them. Consider an user sending funds to the smart contract. They will be collected by another user calling any of the `execute`, `executeBatch`, `executeWithCallback` or `executeBatchWithCallback` functions due to the fact that all of them call the `_fill` function.
## Code Snippet
#### The `_fill` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/reactors/BaseGladiusReactor.sol#L248):
```solidity
222:    function _fill(ResolvedOrder[] memory orders) internal {
        .
        .
        .
248:        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
249:            CurrencyLibrary.transferNative(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
250:        }
251:   }
```

#### The `transferNative` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-rubicon-finance/blob/main/gladius-contracts-internal/src/lib/CurrencyLibrary.sol#L56):
```solidity
        function transferNative(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
            (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
            if (!success) revert NativeTransferFailed();
        }
```

## Recommendation
Make additional calculations to make sure that the `msg.sender` receives only the funds that belong to them.
