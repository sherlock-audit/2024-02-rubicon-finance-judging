# `GladiusOrderQuoter::quote()` vulnerable to `frontrunning` attacks

## Summary
The `GladiusOrderQuoter` contract is vulnerable to `frontrunning` attacks due to its ability to pre-process orders off-chain.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `quote()` method calls the reactor's `executeWithCallback` prematurely, providing order details to any observer before actual execution. This allows frontrunning where another party can submit their own order using the leaked information, such as submitting with a better price if it is a buy order.

```solidity
    function quote(
        bytes memory order,
        bytes memory sig,
        uint256 quantity
    ) external returns (ResolvedOrder memory result) {
        try
            getReactor(order).executeWithCallback(
                SignedOrder(order, sig),
                quantity,
                bytes("")
            )
        {} catch (bytes memory reason) {
            result = parseRevertReason(reason);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
It allows opportunistic traders to gain an advantage over the originators by reacting faster based on the leaked order details.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The quote method should not actually call the reactor contract to pre-process orders. It should only validate the order structure without revealing details or pre-executing.
